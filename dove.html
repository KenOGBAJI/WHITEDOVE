            Donald J. Trump is the very definition<br>
             of the American success story,<br>
             continually setting the standards<p>
                
             </p> of excellence while expanding <br>
             his interests in real estate, sports, and entertainment. <br>
             He is the archetypal businessman – a deal maker without peer.

Mr. Trump started his business career in an office he shared <br>
with his father in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, New York. He worked<br>
 with his father for five years,<br>
  where they were busy making deals together.<br>


Mr.Trump has been quoted as saying, <br>
  “My father was my mentor, and I learned<br>
   a tremendous amount about every aspect of the construction industry<br>
    from him.” Likewise, Fred C. <p>

    </p>Trump often stated that “some of<br>
     my best deals were made by my son, Donald...everything<br>
      he touches seems to turn to gold.” Mr. Trump then entered<br>
       the very different world of Manhattan real estate.
